# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis for Vietnamese Cleanser Product Reviews in E-commerce

Forecasting aspects and associated sentiments in Vietnamese facial cleanser product reviews on E-commerce sites.

### Example Illustration:
Input: Sữa rửa mặt mình thích cực, khả năng làm sạch rất tốt, mình dùng 2 tháng đã khỏi mụn, giá lại rất rẻ nữa (I absolutely love this face wash, its cleaning ability is excellent, my acne cleared up after two months of use, and it's very affordable too)

Output: Quality: Positive, Price: Positive.
